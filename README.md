# A Concept-driven Common Representation Space for Recommendation
=================================================================================

Results and specific detail used for the paper "A Concept-driven Common Representation Space for Recommendation" by [Ángel Castellanos](http://nlp.uned.es/~acastellanos/), [Ana García-Serrano](http://nlp.uned.es/web-nlp/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11) and [Juan Cigarrán](http://nlp.uned.es/~juanci/)

## Dataset

For experimentation we made use of the "2nd Linked Open Data-enabled Recommender Systems Challenge" dataset. For more detail on the dataset, please refer to:

## Results

[results/task1](https://github.com/AngelCastellanos/common-space-recommendation/tree/master/results/task1) includes the results for the Task 1: Top-N recommendations from unary user feedback. This task deals with the top-N recommendation problem, in which a system is requested to find and recommend a limited set of N items that best match a user profile, instead of correctly predict the ratings for all available items.
